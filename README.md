# LeetCode

This repository has my LeetCode solutions.

Usually you create and submit the solutions on LeetCode Web page.
So you can't create your repository of the solutions.
But I submit my solutions via the VSCode LeetCode plugin.
Then I can create a repository of my LeetCode solutions on GitHub.

On this repository I show you my ability to solve problems by C lang, Go lang,
C++ lang, and so on.
